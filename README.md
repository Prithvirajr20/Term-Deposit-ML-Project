- **Notebooks:** Explore data analysis, modeling, and evaluation in Jupyter notebooks located in the `notebooks/` directory.
- **Scripts:** Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development are in the `scripts/` directory.
- **Requirements:** To install required dependencies, use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Model:** The trained machine learning model is saved in the `model/` directory.

## Usage

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to perform data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

3. The trained model, located in the `model/` directory, can be used for making predictions.
